# Flake Maker - Game by Jutier

**Flake Maker** is a simulation game where you can observe and control the growth of a snowflake, watching it branch and expand over time. You can control the growth process with the environmental parameters humidity and temperature.

Enjoy experimenting with different settings and watch your snowflake!


## Controls

- **Arrow Up/Down**: Increase/decrease the humidity value
- **Arrow Right/Left**: Increase/decrease the temperature value
- **R**: Restarts the snowflake
- **Space**: Pause or resume the snowflake's growth updates


## Tips
Branches are created only at low humidity, but you need more humidity to make them grow.
The temperature changes mostly the mobility of the water. It means you can change the humidity from the inner branches.
You can also change the thickness of the branches with low humidity if they don't meet the conditions to create more branches.
Don't feel discouraged to explore, it's not obvious how it works. If you want try to take a look at the script.

## Bugs && Features

The whole code is here for you to change or do whatever you want, a reference to this would be nice, but not nescessary. If you feel like, give it a try and change the Line.update() method, it's complicated at best but manageable.

I've tried to fix everything I could find, but at some point I don't know what is a bug and what is a feature.

## How to run

If you just want to play, just run the .exe file.
If you want to do your own changes to the game and run that, you'll need to run the main.pyw script inside scripts
